# Architecture — jira-automation

Overview
- Main components:
  - Jira API client: a small wrapper around Jira REST endpoints.
  - Rule engine: evaluates configured automation rules and schedules actions.
  - Orchestrator: receives events (webhooks, scheduler, CLI) and triggers the engine.
  - Storage: persists rules, state and logs (could be DB, filesystem or other).
  - Optional UI/CLI: to manage rules and view logs.

Data flow
1. Event arrives (webhook, scheduled job or manual CLI invocation).
2. Orchestrator normalizes the event into an internal representation.
3. Rule engine selects applicable rules based on event/context.
4. Actions are executed via adapters (Jira, notifications, etc.).
5. Results and logs are persisted and optionally notified.

Key design decisions
- Separation of concerns: business logic (rules) is separate from adapters (Jira, DB)
  to improve testability and extensibility.
- Network resilience: use retries and exponential backoff for external calls.
- Secrets management: environment variables and vaults are preferred — do not
  commit secrets.

Extensibility
- Add new adapters (e.g. Slack) by implementing the adapter interface.
- Add rule validation as a plugin for CI to prevent invalid automations from being merged.

Security
- Never log secrets or tokens.
- Use least-privilege credentials for Jira API tokens.
